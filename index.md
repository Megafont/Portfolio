# About Me
My name is Michael, and I'm an animal lover. I've been into computer programming since I was a kid, thanks to a toy called Pre-Computer 1000 that had a basic programming mode in it. Of course, it was a very stripped down version of the language BASIC. I remember being fascinated that I could make that little computer do whatever I wanted. From there, I moved on through a number of additional langauges:

I've also dabbled a little in a few other languages, such as LUA and Java. My favorite language is **C#**, and most of my programming knowledge is self-taught.


# Algorithms and 3D
As someone with a passion for video games, I also dug into Unity and Blender as a more practical avenue of game development than C++. My first foray into 3D editors was
actually the Hammer Editor for the original *Half-Life* game as a teenager. I enjoy playing around with new algorithms and techniques and learning how things work, so its not surprising that I'm into science, too. My favorite video game series is *The Legend of Zelda*, with *Ocarina of Time* being my top pick. Valve's *Half-Life* games are also at the top of my list. Using the Hammer Editor a lot and trying to make a mod with my brother and some friends led to me writing my own GUI compile manager to make compiling maps more convenient, and later rewrote it in C++:
